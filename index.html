			<p>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The data visualization captures the cyclic nature of the data well. By plotting
					the data in a spiral, the visualization captures how the data changes over the course 
					of the year.</li>
				<li>The extreme contraction in new COVID cases in July 2021 gives me both the impression of how 
					seasonal the virus is and how effective the vaccine rollout was.
				</li>
				<li>By including the first few weeks of January in the data right at the end of the 
					spiral the author demonstrates how rapidly the omicron was spreading at the time of
					the article. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The design gives a good impression of the number of cases, but its lack of gridlines on the spiral
					makes it difficult to determine the exact number of cases at any given point. The small scale in the 
					corner of the visualization is difficult to use due to its distance from the main visualization. This 
					makes it difficult to make any quantitative ratio judgements about the data.
				</li>
				<li>The original article was primarily about the new more virulent omicron varient of COVID yet the plot
					makes no distinction between the different varients of COVID. This makes it difficult to determine the
					impact of the omicron varient on the overall number of cases. This could lead the audience to conclude 
					incorrect conclusions about the impact of the omicron varient on the overall number of cases or the
					effectiveness of public health measures.
				</li>
				<li>In a similar vein one of the primary concerns at the time the article was written was hosptial capacity 
					and the mortality rate of the omicron varient. By not including any information about hosptializations or
					deaths the visualization may not capture the success of the vaccine rollout in preventing severe cases of
					COVID or the reported lower hosptialization and mortality rate of the omicron varient. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The visualization also fails to capture transmission rates of the virus well. Because of the exponential
					nature of the virus, the number of cases can increase rapidly. By not including any information about the
					transmission rates of the virus the visualization does not capture the main idea of the article well that
					the omicron varient was spreading rapidly.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="Sketch 1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
				<figcaption>
          Sketch 1: In my first sketch I wanted to create a very simple visualization that provided an improved interface 
		  for making quantitative judgements about the data. I included a common baseline for all the data to allow for
		  direct quantitative ratio comparisons. I also included gridlines to make it easy to make quantitative determinations
		  about the data. I included the 2022 projections to reinforce the idea that the omicron varient was spreading rapidly
		  and could have major impacts on the number of cases. What works well in this visualization is its simplicity and ease
		  of understanding. The data is very clear and easy to read and compare. Some elements that could be improved are better 
		  spacing of the data to allow for the vertical axis to be more easily read, error bars or some other indication of the
		  uncertainty in the 2022 projections. Another element I would like to improve is the granulaity of the data. By aggregating
		  the data by month I lose some of the detail of the data. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Common baseline allows for direct quantitative ratio comparisons.</li>
				<li>Direct comparison of data by month across different years. Very clear gridlines to make quantitative determinations
					easy to make.
				</li>
				<li>
					Including 2022 projections into the future to reinforce the idea that the omicron varient was spreading rapidly and 
					could have major impacts on the number of cases.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="Sketch 2.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
				<figcaption>
					Sketch 2: In the second sketch I wanted to creae a visulaizaiton that captured the trends over time at a more granular level
					than the first sketch. I included line segments for each of the years present in the data and included dotted lines to demonstrate
					the continuitiny of the data between years. Finally, I clearly deliniated projections in another color with a cone of uncertainty to
					reflect that projection uncertainty increases as we move further into the future. This presentation allows for a more granular 
					comparison of data in the relevant months year to year. Importantly the common scale and gridlines allow for quantitative ratio
					comparisons to be made. The line segments could be improved upon because rather than conveying continuity they make the visualization
					more disjoint and cluttered than it needs to be. The projection fan also rapidly exceeds the bounds of the data indicating that a log scale 
					may be more appropriate for the data in this form. Finally, I worry that the visualization does not fairly compare the different years as 
					because of the different starting points of each year and the exponential nature of viral infections the first years have an "unfair"
					advantage in the visualization and may leave the reader with the feeling that we are not making progress in the fight against COVID.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Capture the continuous nature of time more effectively with a line chart.</li>
				<li>Still allow for easy quantitative comparison betweeen years. </li>
				<li>Clearly demonstrate where the data turns into a projection and show the uncertainty in the projections.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="Sketch 3.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%"/>
				<figcaption>
					Sketch 3: In the third sketch I wanted to facet out the various aspects of the virus mentioned in the source article 
					including the transmission rate, the hospitalization rate, and the mortality rate. I included a line chart for each of
					these aspects of the virus with a common scale. Since the original visualization did not contain any information about
					the transmission rate, hospitalization rate, or mortality rate I based it on the general trends of the virus. This plot 
					does a better job of capturing a "fair" representation of the data across the different years. By dividing new cases by
					the total number of cases it corrects for the exponential nature of the virus and the fact that different years started 
					with drastically different infected bases. By keeping the data in a single continuous line on each facet I believe it 
					captures the continuity better than sketch 2, though it does make it more difficult to compare the different aspects of the
					virus in a particular month across years. The projections are also more difficult to read in this visualization because of the
					it happens on the far right of the visualization, causing the reader to have to look back and forth between the left and 
					right sides of the visualization to make comparisons. I tried to mitigate this effect by including gridlines across the 
					visualization. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Facet out more of the components of the virus mentioned in the source article.</li>
				<li>Make the comparisons more "fair" across years by making the data rates rather than absolute numbers.</li>
				<li>Highlight that new cases does not directly translate to more hospitalizations or deaths due to immunity via the vaccine.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        For the final visualization I decided to go "back to the basics" as the visualization is geared towards a general audience so the 
		most important element of the design is that the visualization is clear and easy to understand. Due to the time series nature of the data I chose the line mark 
		with an x-axis representing time and a y-axis representing the number of new cases. To make quantitative ratio comparisons easier I chose
		to include gridlines that run horizontally across the data. I chose to also include the transmission rate through the visual encoding channels of
		both color and thickness in the line. To calculate the transmision rate I used the number of new cases in a day, divided by the number of new cases in the last 
		14 days (a proxy for active number of infected population). Transmission rate is a crucial element to understanding disease dynamics and by including this informaiton it helps
		the viewer understand how the public health measures introduced changed the spread of the disease even if new cases continued to tick up. It also helps compare 
		across time as the transmission rate is a function of the number of current infected population helping to make more "fair" comparisons between years even if they
		had vastly different case numbers. I chose this dual encoding because it is difficult to make judgements for close points in terms
		of color but it is easy to make judgements about the thickness of the line. Similarly making judgements of thickeness for points that are
		far apart is difficult but making judgements about their color is easier. By using this dual encoding I hoped to add a new layer of information
		to the original visualization that highlights one of the important elements of the original article, the transmission rate. I chose to end the timeline
		roughly where the article ended to not give myself any unfair advantage in the prroducing a visualization as I am sure the original
		author would have made different decisions about the data if they had access to the data I do. An element of the data that I am worried is lost in 
		my visualization is the impact of the vaccine and virus mutations on mortality and hospitalization rates. I chose not to include them as I wanted to 
		keep the visualization simple, yet I worry that their omission may lead the viewer to incorrect conclusions about the impact of the vaccine and greater
		fears about the new omicron varient which could sew fear and panic in the general population.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        In creating the final visualization I was not able to address all of my critiques of the orignial visualization. I was able to make the data more
		quantitative and easier to understand but I was not able to address the lack of information about hospitalizations and deaths. In seeking to incorporate
		this informaiton I got a better understanding of the tradeoff between simplicity and density of information in a visualization. Whenever I tried to incorporate 
		more information about the virus the visualization became more cluttered and difficult to understand. Ultimately I worried that this information overload would
		detract users from engaging with the visualization at all, or possibly lead to misunderstanding of the data presented. In keeping with my core critique of the
		original visualization I ensured that my visualization allowed for easy quantitative ratio comparisons had a common baseline and included gridlines. I also included 
		some annotations ito the visualization to remind the reader of important dates and public health measures that were introduced. One phenomenon that the original visualization
		captured more effectively than mine was the cyclic nature of the virus. By using a spiral the original visualization lined up months across years and made the annual pattern more
		obvious. Overall, I believe I was successful in creating a visualization that was more easily understood and allowed for more quantitative ratio comparisons than the original.
